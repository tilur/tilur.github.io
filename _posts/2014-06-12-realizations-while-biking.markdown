#### Item the first...

There is a lot of hoopla between cyclists and motorists on the road. Cyclits complain about bad drivers and vice versa also happens to be true. Anyone who doesn't agree that there are guilty parties on both sides of the coin are either asleep or unwilling to accept fact.

What I've come to realize though, is that the people who are complaining about the other parties, generally don't do the other activity. By that I mean, drivers who are angry at bikers, because they're taking up space on the road, probably don't commute using a bicycle. And bikers who flip the finger to drivers non-stop, probably don't drive that much.

#### Item the second...

Biking on a not-so-busy street with a streetcar is pretty good interval training. If you're polite and you abide by the rules that you stop when the streetcar doors open, you're probably going to be stopping a bit for people to dis/embark. When the street is empty of cars, the TTC can get moving at a pretty good clip, which is generally faster than my clip. So you take off faster than transit, but they end up passing you... just to stop at the next corner to pick people up. This means you have to stop to, because you're a proper cyclist, right?

What ends up happening is good interval training. My bike currently has gears on it, but I never use them. I have my sights set on a fixed-gear bike, or fixie if you will. For a while, I've been behaving as if my bike only has one gear, so the legs really get going when doing battle with transit.
