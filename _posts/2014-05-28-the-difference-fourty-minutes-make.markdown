This morning I was behind my Mario-Kart-ghost-self while getting The Daughter ready for school (daycare) and myself ready for work. Recently, I've been driving to work a lot, The Love of My Life's license has expired and she hasn't had the time to renew it just now, exams and studying for exams have commandeered all of her time. Because of that, the car is readily available for me to use on the regular.

Today, I had a couple errands to do before heading in to work. First and foremost, I had to bring Hadley to school. After that, the bank needed to be visited to relieve my pocket of a chunk of money. Before being able to leave for work, the transporter needed to be refuled. All of these things are very close in proximity to each other, as well as my house. The petrol on the other hand was a dire need. My favourite orange fuel pump light was on the whole way home from work last night, which means the pointer was burried below the fill-up-your-car-now marker on the guage. Fear of being stuck in the middle of my tasks, with no fuel and the thought of having to push the car around, was less than appealing. So Hadley and I walked to school, I walked to the bank and the only thing the car needed to do, was make it to the gas station.

By the time the fuel guage was happy (ish...), it was almost 9:00am. I try to be in the office by 9:00am and at this point, I hadn't started my gridlock battle yet. My place of employment is kind enough to have "flex hours", which means you can show up anywhere between 8:00am and 10:00am, so long as you're in the office for eight hours. So it's not really an issue of being late, but I'd rather be in around 9:00am none-the-less. Things were not looking so awesome as anyone who drives A) in the city of Toronto; B) on the Gardiner anywhere near downtown; knows... it's an arduous task.

####To my surprise!

It was smooth sailing, the whole way in. The TL;DR is that I made it to my desk in roughly 25 minutes. But the amazement to me, was that the Gardiner **and** the Lakeshore were both moving at a reasonable clip. Since the construction started on the Gardiner, it's been kind of annoying. It really starts to get bogged down just at the point where I'm departing the roadway (Spadina). But lately, there's been construction on the Lakeshore between my highway exit and office entrance, so this has been a bummer too. But this day, there was no pain.

I guess what I realized, is that if you're travelling on the thoroughfares **after** the time that everyone is rushing to work, there aren't any bottlenecks. It makes sense really, I've just never paid attention to it. Perhaps I should, on purpose, leave my house closer to 9:00am, knowing that I'm going to get to the office around the same time I would if I left at 8:20am.
