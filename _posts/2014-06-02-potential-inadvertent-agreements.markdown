Lately, Hadley and I have been going on bike rides. We have a Chariot that we hook up to the bike and she can hang out in the trailer and easily look around and play with whatever she's got in there with her. The overwhelming consensus is that she's really into bike rides. When doing a status check at a red light, she responded with "I love it!". Her hair flowing in the wind is something that is very obviously a plus for her... The window down in the car while driving gives her the same experience.

It's an emotional roller coaster though, that always ends on a low... Hadley never wants to go home. After heading out into the surrounding neighbourhood from the house a pretty good distance, I was informed that she was getting tired, so we started to head back home. When we were getting close to the "home stretch", I let her know that we would be home soon and she was super bummed. I asked her what was wrong and she started to cry and told me "I don't want to go home". The solution to this was, of course, more biking.

What I've discovered while we're biking around however, is that I might eventually agree to something I'm not aware of. Hadley isn't the loudest kid on the block. When she's in the Chariot behind me and we're travelling, she talks to me and asks questions. Sometimes though, I can't hear her over the road noise. My usual tactic when I don't understand her: like any parent, ask her again. If I'm still unsure after a couple more attempts, I'll make a game-time decision and respond with something fitting, given what I was able to figure out from her question. A lot of the time though, this response is "OK". My reasoning, is that I don't want to give her a "because" answer. I try to satisfy her query with something that is definitive. I don't want to answer her with something that she doesn't get a valid reasoning with.

The problem here is, she's starting to put more thoughts together and making more connections between things. She's asking more bizarre questions and remembering more pieces of converations... she's growing up! With this new state of affairs, compounded with the I-can't-hear/understand-what-you're-asking plus my need to give her a non-"because" answer equals a potential for me to agree to getting her a pet hippo for her birthday because her best friend and a dream and was riding a girrafe. I'd like to think that when this realization comes to the dinner table, I'd be able to talk my way out of it, but then there's a whole explanation of **why** we can't get a pet hippo.

Now, I could of course pull over to the side of the road, get off the bike and determine what Hadley is asking for, but who wants to do that. You're out on the bike, riding around, not travelling 300 feet and pulling over (rinse, repeat...). My hope however, is two-fold: She doesn't ask for ridiculous things that I can't deliver on; and that she'll simply get louder. She does indeed have a set of lungs on her, when she's REAL upset about things, she can pipe up. It's the middle ground we'll have to work on, then the discern between outside and inside voices will be the next battle.
