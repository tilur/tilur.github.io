I was thinking the other morning about UX (User Experience for those not in the know…) and what it means. I’ve taken part in a conversation a couple of times, about how UX is more than just the experience the user has on the site you’re working on. It also includes the state of mind the user is in WHILE they’re on your site. To go further in the thought, it encompasses the user’s surroundings during their visit as well.

#### How do I know what chair they're sitting on?

You don’t. There is little knowledge you could have about the user’s physical surroundings.

Aside from you incorporating webcam usage, having the user allow you to take a photo of their surroundings, developing some recognition algorithms and parsing power to determine what books they have on their bookshelf behind them, developing the artificial intelligence required to determine how likely they are to be in a whimsical state of mind due to the fact they have The Eyre Affair (Jasper Fforde) front and centre behind them… you don’t have any idea.

The truth is, physical items are not going to play a part in the decisions you make about how to develop your website. They will only play a part in the user’s state of mind while they’re doing ANYthing in front of their computer.

#### So why think about it?

It was more mental conjecture, than anything. But you can get a sliver of an idea of what your users might be doing by looking at the referrers to your site. Using your web servers logs, you can examine what sites your users are on right before they come to your plot. This isn’t a guaranteed piece of evidence, as it’s up to the browser to send the header through on the new request, so don’t bank on it.

After doing some investigation, you can analyze the values that do come through the data. With this information, you can make some educated decisions on your design and function. One thing to keep in mind of course, is that site needs to have links inward from elsewhere to have referral information. If your user is looking at pictures of kittens on Imgur, then types in the address of your stead, you’re not going to get your referral data. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the more inward links you have, the more Google likes you. It’s in your best interest to make some friends and get them send some traffic your way.

#### Putting it together.

The though here, is that you can examine the referring sites and look at their design. Something about that site is enticing to your user, so why not try to incorporate that into your layout. I of course am not saying you should flat-out copy your referring site’s designs. I’m suggesting to use them as some inspiration. Find some bits that get your senses tingling and emulate, not xerox, into your flow and see what works.

“Great minds think alike…” pops to the front of the brain right now. If there is something that works, why not work a bit of it in, meld it into something that is original in your own design, and run with it. “… But fools seldom differ”. This part should scream at you to NOT plagiarize your inspiration. The referring sites should be nothing more than exactly that… Inspiration.

The idea here is that it’s another arrow in your quiver. It’s not meant to be William Tell’s arrow used to shoot the apple off some poor bastard’s head.
