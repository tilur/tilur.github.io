This morning, I was waiting on the corner of Broadview and Gerrard for the 504 streetcar. There were others there waiting for the same 504 streetcar, I wasn't alone. Minding my own business, I was scanning the street looking for something to postpone my boredom. Things have become better with the frequency of the arrivals, but today was a bit slower...

Just as I was panning from left-to-right, I noticed a guy in red ski pants walking past. I especially noticed him when he stopped directly in front of me and said:

### "Hey!"

Like he'd just been searching the whole city for me specifically and just found me. My pan stopped and we made eye contact. Right away, I thought I was going to be involved in an altercation. Evasive manoeuvres started flitting through my minds eye, until reality set in and dressy shoes in sloppy snow washed away the Michael Bay scene from my imagination. The guy in front of me starts to raise his right hand, formed in a fist, up to beside his head. At this point I'm thinking for sure this guy is going to throw some bombs. You could tell he was out to lunch though, if this was a cartoon, there would be a green stink cloud around him and an empty bottle of moonshine in his other hand.

So now dude is standing a few feet away from me, with his hand cocked beside his head and he's looking a me. Not at any of the people around my periphery, but me... and says:

### "You want a knuckle sandwhich!?"

Then starts to laugh. My response:

### "Nah, I'm alright thanks. I've already eaten".

After this, the situation seem to be diffused and the guy was pretty chatty. I wasn't really engaged in the conversation, for fear of the shifty begining turning into a way shiftier ending, but I listened and responded here and there. The topics covered everything from the amount of snow we've seen in the last couple days, how much money you can make in a day shovelling said snow, the fact that he was trying to get some long johns from [Good Sheppard](http://www.goodshepherd.ca/ "Good Sheppard") but ended up with the red ski pants, how warm the ski pants are and something unintelligble about his girlfriend.

All in all, he seemed like an alright dude, just really explosive with his entrance. When the 504 streetcar finally showed up, our conversation ended cordially and he started to get in line for the transporter. As much as I wanted to get on that car to get on my way to work, I waited for the next one.
