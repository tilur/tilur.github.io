Recently, I ran into some problems with the transporter starting. It was during the minus-too-much weather of the winter we just had when the problem started. At first, I thought it was just because it was too cold and the car figuratively rolled over and pulled the blanket up and told me to "sod off". This only happened a couple times, again when it was really cold out, so I figured that it was just the age of the battery starting to show it's wear.

Winter was winding down (took it's time didn't it?) and I started to experience the non-start again. It quickly got to the point where the battery as not holding a charge at all. You could drive the car from one end of the city to the other and as soon as you turned it off, it would not start up again.

####Time to admit it...

The car is eight years old, I've had it for seven of those years and I've never changed the battery. I think it was time. There was a bit of hoopla in getting a new power cell, but in the end, the new one was in my hands and it was ready to be installed into the chariot. Queue darkness... The daylight was gone, but the car needed to start in the morning. So I'm outside, trying to hold up the floor board to the trunk (the battery lives below) with one hand, while gripping my flashlight-enabled phone with my teeth... through my lips... and trying to loosen **really** tight bolts; designed to keep the battery from moving. In retrospect, I should have just removed the floor board so I could have had two hands to work with, but I'm lazy.

After everything is done, the car starts. Amazing. My worries are behind me, the new battery is in and there is nothing to worry about.

####Queue a month later...

This morning Hadley and I were getting ready to leave. It's already challenging enough to get her out of the door. There are just so many things along the way that are way cooler than going to school. We finally get seated, her in her "super safe seat", me in the passenger chair (just checking, you still with me?). Key goes into the ignition like the million other times it has AND... it doesn't turn over.

Ughh.

It can't be the battery. It's so new. How could the original one last **eight** years, and this one only a month? I realize that it has some shelf life in the store, but ca'man! The only difference here, is that the car sounds different and is behaving slightly different too. It certainly tries to turn over, it's just not making it all the way. But after the burst of energy, it's like the connection is disappearing then reappearing immediately after.

It can't be installation error: there are two poles to connect. Now, the terminals might not be as tightly squeezed as they were from the factory, but they're not loose (I checked). I still don't know what the issue is. My vehicle has a nice feature that it will turn off any interior light that is left on for too long, I'm not sure what the timeout is. This is of course to prevent a dead battery in the morning when you really need to get to work and are expecting the car to start, right?

But that moment, right after you realize that the car did not start when it's supposed to. And you look in the back seat and your daughter is sitting in her chair, stoked to get going. And your coffee is waiting to be consumed while you drive to work. And then you realize you have some decision to make. That moment!
