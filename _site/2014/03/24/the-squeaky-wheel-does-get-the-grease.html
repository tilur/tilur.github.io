                <h1>The Squeaky Wheel DOES Get The Grease</h1>
                <p>The office had recently put into a place a “suggestion box” in the lunch room. HR had made it clear that we should take advantage of the box and suggest things to make our lives better in the work place. I generally don’t use these types of boxes, but there was something I wanted to get in the lunch room that would make my life better…</p>

<h4 id="instant-hot-water">Instant hot water.</h4>

<p>We have a kettle in there, but people generally don’t have the decency of refilling it when they’ve used all the water and clicking the button to boil the water again before they leave. This means that I tend to get an empty kettle and have to wait while the water boils. It’s not the end of the world, I know, but it’s idle time that I don’t want to spend waiting for water to boil. Up until not that long ago, this wouldn’t have been a problem for me, but my Missus gifted me an Aero Press for Christmas this year, so I’ve been making a lot of my coffee opposed to talking the walk to Starbucks.</p>

<p>I started to periodically put “suggestions” into the suggestion box, hinting that it would be a cool idea if we could get a tap that only had hot water. I had in mind the type that sit off to the side of the sink and deplete a 60-ish cup reservoir, so no one has to wait around for a kettle to boil. This not only serves me, as there are a lot of tea drinkers in the office. I varied the type of message on the entries, one indicating that “kettles are so 2013”. The idea was to try and not be monotonous in my message</p>

<p>As I was making my coffee this morning, I noticed some people hovering around the robot coffee, looking at a new installation between the fridge and “coffee” machine. It turns out that, my repeated attempts to suggest a hot water tap have worked! HR has put into place, what looks like a water cooler, but it has two buttons on it: hot and cold. My requests have been answered. The funny part of it is, while I was looking at it, an HR delegate came into the lunch room and she mentioned that they just put it in today. So naturally, I asked if it was due to my “suggestions”… She laughed and said “was that you?”</p>

<p>I didn’t see the new addition until I had already made my Joe (and refilled the kettle, no doubt), so I haven’t had a chance to experience it yet. I’m sure there isn’t anything to be let down about, hot water is hot water. The take-away from this: don’t be annoying in your repeated attempts to get something you’d like, the very nature of repeated attempts is annoying enough.</p>
